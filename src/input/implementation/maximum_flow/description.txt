Implement the algorithm to find a maximum flow in a directed graph.
[Optional: implement minimum-cost flow problem.]


Input:
First line has 5 integers, N, M, s, t and D.
N: the number of vertices, M: number of edges, s: source, t: sink.
D is the number of units of flow to send for the min-cost flow problem.
Vertices are numbered 0..N-1.  M is at most 10 Million.
Each of the next M lines of input have 4 positive integers:
u, v, c, b: edge (u,v) with capacity c and cost b per unit of flow.
For the maximum flow problem (without costs), disregard costs and D.

Output:
First line of output has the value of the objective: size of maximum flow
for the maximum flow problem, and the minimum cost of sending D units of flow
for the min-cost flow problem.  The next M lines of output specify the flow
through each edge for the optimal solution.

Sample inputs/outputs will be provided soon.
