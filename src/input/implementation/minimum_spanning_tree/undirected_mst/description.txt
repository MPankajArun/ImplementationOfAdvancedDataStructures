CS 6301.014 Implementation of advanced Data Structures and Algorithms
Fall 2013
Project 6 (optional)
Oct 21, 2013

Due: 2 AM, Monday, November 11 on elearning

This is an optional project.

Compare the performance of the following minimum spanning tree algorithms:

1. Prim's algorithm (implementation 1 - see lecture notes)
2. Prim's algorithm (implementation 2)
3. Kruskal's algorithm
4. MST algorithm in directed graphs

Test your algorithms on graphs with up to 1,000,000 edges.

Input: First line of input has 2 integers, N and M (|V| and |E|).
The next M lines of input have 3 integers in each line: u,v,w
indicating edge (u,v) of weight w.  Assume that all weights are
nonnegative integers.  If the algorithm needs a source node, use
vertex 1 as the source.

Sample input:
5 6
1 2 3
1 4 5
4 5 9
1 5 6
2 5 7
2 3 5

Output:
19

Sample input for directed graph:
5 7
1 5 8
1 4 7
1 3 6
4 3 3
3 5 6
5 3 2
5 2 1

Output:
17
